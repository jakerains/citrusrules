# Coding Style Guidelines

- Use ES modules syntax (`import`/`export`) throughout the project
- Follow these naming conventions:
  - Use `camelCase` for variable and function names
  - Use `UPPER_SNAKE_CASE` for constants (e.g., `TEMPLATE_URL_BASE`)
  - Prefix private or internal functions with underscore (e.g., `_internalFunction`)
- Prefer `async`/`await` over Promise chains
- Use string template literals for string interpolation
- Use the chalk library for terminal output styling
- Use descriptive variable and function names that indicate purpose
- Keep functions short and focused on a single responsibility
- Use JSDoc comments for functions that are exported
- Use proper error handling with try/catch blocks
