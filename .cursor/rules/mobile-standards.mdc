# Mobile Development Standards

Apply these practices when building mobile apps.

## Architecture

- Separate business logic from UI components.
- Use dependency injection for testability.
- Keep navigation flows well defined.

## Performance

- Minimize rendering work on the main thread.
- Dispose of listeners and subscriptions properly.
- Use profiling tools to detect bottlenecks.

## UX Considerations

- Support accessibility features like screen readers.
- Optimize for different screen sizes and orientations.
- Keep touch targets large and consistent.

```swift
// Swift example snippet
struct ContentView: View {
  var body: some View {
    Text("Hello, world!")
      .padding()
  }
}
```

Consistent standards lead to reliable and user-friendly mobile apps.
