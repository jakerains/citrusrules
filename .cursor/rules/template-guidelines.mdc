# Cursor Rule Template Guidelines

## Template Structure
- All `.mdc` files must include a YAML frontmatter section at the top with appropriate metadata:
  ```yaml
  ---
  description: Brief description of what the rule does
  globs: ["**/*.js"]  # Optional: files to which this rule applies
  alwaysApply: false  # Optional: whether to always apply this rule
  ---
  ```
- One of these metadata types must be specified:
  - `alwaysApply: true` → Rule is included in every AI context
  - `globs: ["**/*.js"]` → Rule applied when working with matching files
  - `description: "..."` (with no other metadata) → AI decides when to apply
  - No metadata → Only applied when explicitly referenced with `@ruleName`

## Template Content
- Use Markdown formatting for the rule content
- Organize rules with headings, bullet points, and code examples
- Reference specific files with: `[filename.js](mdc:filename.js)`
- Be specific and concise in rule descriptions
- Include examples for complex rules
- Focus on actionable guidance, not general documentation

## Adding Templates with CitrusRules CLI
- Use the following command to add templates:
  ```bash
  npx citrusrules --feature --agent
  ```
- Each flag corresponds to a specific template:
  - `--feature`: Fetches feature.mdc template
  - `--agent`: Fetches agent.mdc template
- Templates are stored in `.cursor/rules/` directory
